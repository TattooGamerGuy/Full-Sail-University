                <strong>The Elder Scrolls V:</strong> <em>Skyrim</em> is a 2011
                action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and
                published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main
                installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The Elder
                Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), and was released worldwide for
                Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11,
                2011.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion and takes
                place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel, a
                continent on the planet Nirn. Its main story focuses on the
                player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat
                Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy
                the world. Over the course of the game, the player completes
                quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game
                continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by
                allowing the player to travel to discovered locations in the
                game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main
                storyline indefinitely.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Skyrim</em> was developed using the Creation Engine, which
                was rebuilt specifically for the game. The team opted for a
                unique and more diverse open world than Oblivion's Imperial
                Province of Cyrodiil, which game director and executive producer
                Todd Howard considered less interesting by comparison.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise
                for its character advancement, world design, visuals, and
                dual-wielding combat. Criticism targeted the melee combat,
                dragon battles, and numerous technical issues present at launch.
                The game shipped over seven million units within the first week
                of its release and had sold over 20 million units by June 2013.
                It is considered one of seventh generation console gaming's most
                significant titles and one of the greatest video games ever
                made.
              </p>

                Three downloadable content (<em>DLC</em>) add-ons were released:
                Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn, which were bundled along
                with the base game into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Legendary
                Edition released in June 2013. A remastered version, The Elder
                Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition, was released for Windows,
                PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2016, with all three DLC
                expansions and a graphical upgrade. A port for the Nintendo
                Switch was released in November 2017. A separate virtual
                reality-only version, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR, was
                released in November 2017 for PlayStation VR, and for
                Windows-based VR headsets in April 2018. In addition, the
                Special Edition was released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
                X/S as part of the compilation The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim â€“
                Anniversary Edition in November 2021, and for Nintendo Switch in
                September 2022. Announced at E3 2018, a new video game in the
                series, The Elder Scrolls VI, is currently in development.[1]

                <strong>The Elder Scrolls V:</strong> <em>Skyrim</em> is a
                fantasy action role-playing game, playable from either a first
                or third-person perspective. The player may freely roam over the
                land of Skyrim, an open world environment based on Scandinavia
                consisting of wilderness expanses, dungeons, caves, cities,
                towns, fortresses, and villages.[2] Players may navigate the
                game world more quickly by riding horses, paying for a ride from
                a city's stable, or utilizing a fast-travel system that allows
                them to move their character immediately to a previously
                discovered location.[3]
              </p>
              <p>
                At the beginning of the game, players select their character's
                sex and race, with 10 choices for the latter including races of
                humans and fantasy races such as elves and orcs. The player
                chooses the character's appearance; this is not necessarily
                permanent, however, as an in-game mechanic allows for changing
                the appearance later.[4] Characters have three primary
                attributes: health is how much damage the character can take
                before dying, magicka is depleted to cast spells, and stamina
                allows the character to perform heavy "power attacks" or sprint.
                A status bar for each attribute appears onscreen when the
                attribute falls below its maximum value. Attributes regenerate
                over time and can be refilled faster by drinking potions,
                casting regenerative spells, or through various enchantments.[5]
                Characters gain experience indirectly, via leveling up skills.
                The 18 skills are divided evenly among the three schools of
                combat, magic, and stealth. Each skill has its own experience
                bar, which increases when the character performs an action
                in-game related to the skill. For example, crafting a dagger
                increases the Smithing skill, and dealing damage with a bow
                increases the Archery skill. When a skill's experience bar
                fills, the skill levels up and the bar is reset. After enough
                skills level up, the character levels up, enabling the player to
                increase the maximum value of one of the three attributes and
                providing a perk point. Perk points can be spent immediately on
                a skill-specific perk or stored for later use.[6][7]
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Non-player characters</strong> (<em>NPCs</em>) populate
                the world; the player may engage them in conversation
                (potentially leading to new quests or map locations), marry
                predetermined ones, or engage them in lethal or nonlethal
                combat. As in previous games in the series, killing certain
                individuals can make some quests or items unobtainable. Certain
                NPCs essential to the narrative cannot be killed by the player,
                and will survive attacks of any magnitude. Committing a crime
                like murder or theft accrues the player a bounty if the crime is
                witnessed, leading to confrontations with guards. Depending on
                some factors, including how serious the crime was, the player
                can choose to go to jail, pay the guard off, persuade the
                witness to forget about it, declare that one is a thane of a
                certain hold (which leads the guard to pardon the player),
                'pacify' the guard or silence witnesses through killing
                them.[8][9]
              </p>
              <p>
                NPCs frequently offer the player side-quests; some have
                parameters adjusted based on nearby unexplored areas.[6][10]
                Some NPCs who are befriended or hired by the player may act as
                companions who will accompany the player and aid them in
                combat.[11] A number of individuals have quests that the player
                needs to complete in order to gain their services as a
                companion. The player may choose to join factions, organized
                groups of NPCsâ€”for example, the Dark Brotherhood, a band of
                assassins.[12] Each of the factions has an associated quest path
                to progress through.[13]
              </p>
              <p>
                The player's effectiveness in combat relies on the use of
                weapons, armor, and enchantments (which may be bought, found
                from containers, raided from dead bodies, stolen and/or forged)
                and on the use of magic spells: similarly, spells may be bought,
                stolen and/or unlocked by finding spell tomes. Weapons, shields,
                and magic are assigned to each hand allowing for dual-wielding,
                and can be swapped out through a quick-access menu of favorite
                items. Some weapons and spells require both hands. Shields can
                be used to fend off enemy attacks and reduce incurred damage or
                offensively through bashing attacks. Blunt, bladed, and hacking
                weapons can be used in close combat and each have specific
                advantages and roles. Power attacks expend stamina to
                temporarily stun/stagger an enemy and deal increased damage.
                Spells have several functions, both in combat (e.g. damaging or
                confusing enemies, resurrecting dead bodies and conjuring other
                entities, restoring the player's health and/or stamina) and out
                (e.g. showing the way to an objective, illuminating a dark room
                or turning iron into silver).[14] Bows are used for long-range
                combat and can be used to bash enemies in melee combat. The
                player can enter sneak mode to pickpocket or deliver powerful
                sneak attacks to unsuspecting enemies.[15]
              </p>
              <p>
                When exploring the game world the player may encounter wildlife.
                Many creatures in the wilderness, such as wolves or bears, are
                immediately hostile towards the player, while other species are
                docile and will run away.[2] Skyrim is the first entry in The
                Elder Scrolls to include dragons in the game's wilderness,
                although dragons are frequently referenced/mentioned in several
                of the other games.[16] Like other creatures, dragons are
                generated randomly in the world and will engage in combat with
                NPCs, creatures and the player. Some dragons may attack cities
                and towns when in their proximity.[17] The player character can
                absorb the souls of dragons in order to use powerful spells
                called "dragon shouts" or "Thu'um". Each shout contains three
                words in the language spoken by dragons, and the strength of the
                shout will vary depending on how many words have been spoken.
                Some words to shouts can be learned by visiting "word walls" in
                dungeons or around the wilderness, while other words can be
                taught by different characters. The words to each shout are
                unlocked for use by spending the absorbed souls of slain
                dragons.[18][19] A regeneration period limits the player's use
                of shouts in gameplay.[20]

              <strong><em>Setting:</em></strong>
            </h3>
            <div class="synopsis-content">
              <p>
                <b>Skyrim</b>, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> is set
                200 years after the events of, although it is not a direct
                sequel.[19] Skyrim is a cold and mountainous region in the north
                of the continent of Tamriel. It has traditionally been divided
                into nine administrative sections, called "holds", each governed
                by a jarl from a larger town. Of these settlements, fiveâ€”
                Solitude, Windhelm, Markarth, Riften, and Whiterunâ€”are larger
                and more powerful. The landscape is littered with forts, camps,
                and ruins, some of which were built by the now-extinct race of
                the Dwemer, or Dwarves. The Nords, one of the human races, view
                Skyrim as their homeland, though members of other races populate
                Skyrim as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Skyrim is a province of the much larger Empire, which comprises
                most of Tamriel. The Empire has recently fought a war with the
                elvish Aldmeri Dominion, who believe that they are racially
                superior to humans. While the conflict, known as the Great War,
                ended in a military stalemate after a hard-fought battle at the
                imperial capital, the greatly weakened Empire was forced to sign
                a humiliating peace treaty called the White-Gold Concordat.
              </p>
              <p>
                While most of Tamriel worship a religious pantheon of eight
                deities, the Nords of Skyrim are accustomed to worshiping a
                ninth god, Talos, the deified Nord general who founded the
                Empire. The Dominion, led by the intolerant Thalmor sect,
                rejects this notion and its implication that a man became
                greater than any elf. They instituted a clause in the Concordat
                forbidding Talos worship in the Empire. Motivated in part by
                this condition, Ulfric Stormcloak, the jarl of Windhelm, leads a
                rebellion against imperial rule, with the holds divided roughly
                evenly between the two sides.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the ancient past, dragons ruled over vast swaths of Tamriel.
                Their hegemony was overthrown when three human warriors threw
                the dragon ruler, Alduin, forward in time using an Elder Scroll,
                a powerful and mysterious artifact. When Skyrim begins, the
                survival of the last dragon, the sage Paarthurnax, is a secret
                kept by an order of monks called the Greybeards. Within their
                monastery atop the Throat of the World, Skyrim's highest
                mountain, the Greybeards dedicate their lives to the Way of the
                Voice, a discipline for powerful draconic spells called
                "shouts". Rare warriors are "Dragonborn", having the ability to
                learn shouts intuitively by absorbing the souls of dead dragons.
                Ancient prophecy maintains that Alduin will return to consume
                the world, and a "Last Dragonborn" will defeat him.
              </p>
              <h3>Characters</h3>
              <p>
                The player character is Dragonborn and is typically referred to
                as such. The Dragonborn can be male or female, from one of ten
                races. Each of the ten races has, in addition to a bonus for
                certain skills, a power specific to their race â€“ for example,
                Nords start with a bonus to several martial skills, and the
                ability to intimidate enemies for a short period. The player can
                recruit one NPC at a time as a follower, who can travel and
                fight alongside the Dragonborn; there are forty-five available
                followers in the base game, with thirteen more added in the
                downloadable expansions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of followers and Alduin (the primary antagonist) NPCs
                prominent to the plot of Skyrim include Balgruuf, Jarl of
                Whiterun, a town in the center of Skyrim; Arngeir, the leader of
                the Greybeards; Delphine and Esbern, two of the last members of
                the Blades, an order of warriors sworn to help the Dragonborn
                but nearly wiped out after the Great War; and Paarthurnax, the
                last surviving dragon and grandmaster of the Greybeards. Also
                notable are General Tullius and Ulfric, who command the Imperial
                Legion and Stormcloaks respectively. During the course of the
                game, the Dragonborn can join and assist either side to gain
                victory in the civil war. Other factions that the Dragonborn can
                elect to join include the Companions, a noble order of warriors;
                the College of Winterhold, an institution dedicated to the
                mystic arts and magic; the Thieves Guild, a league of burglars
                who have fallen on hard times; and the Dark Brotherhood, a
                fellowship of assassins.

            <div class="plot-content">
              <p>
                Imperial soldiers have captured Ulfric Stormcloak and are
                preparing to execute him, along with the player who was caught
                up in the skirmish and mistakenly believed to be a rebel. Before
                the player can be executed, Alduin appears, attacking the
                imperial outpost and thus rescuing the player. The player
                escapes and warns Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun of the dragon
                attack. When another dragon attacks and is slain, the dragon's
                soul flows into the player character, causing the nearby guards
                to call them "Dragonborn". The Greybeards summon the Dragonborn
                to the Throat of the World, where the Dragonborn begins training
                in the Way of the Voice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Delphine intercepts the Dragonborn on a training quest and
                arranges for the Dragonborn to infiltrate the Thalmor Embassy in
                Solitude, on the (mistaken) suspicion that the Thalmor are
                responsible for the dragon attacks. There, they learn that
                Esbern, a Blades lore master obsessed with the prophecy of
                Alduin's return, is alive and hiding in Riften. The Dragonborn
                rescues Esbern from Thalmor agents. Esbern leads them to an
                ancient Blade temple and a massive engraving depicting Alduin's
                prior defeat. Esbern deciphers that the ancient Nords used a
                special shout to remove Alduin's ability to fly and render him
                vulnerable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arngeir does not know the shout, which is called Dragonrend and
                violates the Way of the Voice. Arngeir sends the Dragonborn to
                Paarthurnax at the summit of the Throat. Paarthurnax reveals
                that no one living knows Dragonrend, but theorizes that the
                Dragonborn could learn it by looking through time at the summit,
                the site of Alduin's banishment. To do this, the Dragonborn
                retrieves the Elder Scroll used in the banishment from a massive
                subterranean Dwemer city. The Dragonborn returns to the summit
                and learns Dragonrend. Alduin attacks. The Dragonborn uses
                Dragonrend, and together with Paarthurnax, overpowers Alduin,
                who flees.

                The Dragonborn's allies hatch a plan to capture a dragon at
                Whiterun. The Dragonborn helps negotiate a truce in the civil
                war to prevent either side from capturing Whiterun during this
                delicate operation. The captured dragon, Odahviing, questions
                whether Alduin deserves lordship over dragons. He reveals that
                Alduin has gone to recover his strength in Sovngarde, the Nord
                afterlife, where he feeds on the souls of the dead. Since the
                portal to Sovngarde cannot be reached on foot, Odahviing
                bargains his freedom in exchange for flying the Dragonborn
                there. Entering Sovngarde, the Dragonborn meets the three heroes
                who had defeated Alduin originally. With their help, the
                Dragonborn kills Alduin and returns to Skyrim.

                Upon learning that Paarthurnax is a dragon, the Blades are
                furious and refuse to associate with the Dragonborn further
                unless they slay him. When talking to Paarthurnax, he states it
                is wise not to trust a dragon as their nature is to dominate,
                but asks, 'what is better: to be born good or to overcome your
                evil nature through great effort?' leaving the choice to the
                Dragonborn.
