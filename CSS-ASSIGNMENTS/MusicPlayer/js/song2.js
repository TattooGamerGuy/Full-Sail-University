  lyrics: `
[Verse]
Whispers in the night
Shadows start to crawl
Four hundred years of blight
Decay consumes it all

[Verse 2]
Hunger in the wind
Sickness in the air
Reborn from deep within
A god’s eternal stare

[Chorus]
Pestilence arise
From the ashes and the cries
Silent killer flies
Underneath the darkened skies

[Verse 3]
Death’s a call to power
Counting every breath
In this final hour
He’s the sovereign of death

[Chorus]
Pestilence arise
From the ashes and the cries
Silent killer flies
Underneath the darkened skies

[Bridge]
Born of plague and pain
Walking in the night
Through the endless rain
With disease as his light
