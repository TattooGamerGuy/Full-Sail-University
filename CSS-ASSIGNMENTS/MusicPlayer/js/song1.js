  lyrics: `
[Verse]
In the shadows I walk alone
Cloak of black my only home
Cursed to fight the dire disease
Every four-four-four years reprieve

[Verse 2]
Moon so pale it scars the night
Whispers tell of endless blight
Masked and veiled in fate's cruel jest
An endless battle no time for rest

[Chorus]
Plague doctor rise again
Fight the dark no end in sight
Prophecy's endless chain
Cursed to face eternal night

[Verse 3]
In the streets the cries are loud
Bodies shrouded in a ghostly crowd
Silent prayers to break this curse
For the cure I wander the universe

[Chorus]
Plague doctor rise again
Fight the dark no end in sight
Prophecy's endless chain
Cursed to face eternal night

[Verse 4]
Years go by and come anew
History repeats the pain we knew
Children's eyes filled with dread
The plague awakens from the dead
